    <h1>Our Commitment to Accessibility</h1>
    <p>We aim to create a positive environment that enables everyone to fully experience in the
      services we provide.</p>
    <p>The Pizza31 team strives to comply to at least Level AA of the
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a>.
      We have followed these guidelines during the development process of the website to provide a
      more user-friendly interface for all visitors.
    </p>
    <p>The Pizza31 website is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. As part of the website
      development process, our team has used several tools to test the web pages for accessibility
      issues. We have used
      <a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/">Colour Blindness
        Simulator</a> to test all of the images to ensure that they are suitable for
      colour blind people. Our team also uses
      <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a> to check the validity of
      our web documents and <a href="http://contrastchecker.com/">Contrast Checker</a>
      to provide the best experience possible for all visitors.
